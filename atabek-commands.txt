Hey you! Yes, you! Alone and feeling bored? Nothing excites you anymore? Then you are at the right place! Let me take you on a tour to a magical land called GitCraft! 

You can be whoever you want to be in this world! A shiny picky front-elf? Please! A tough back-dwarf? It is your call! Maybe a mix of both - a powerfull-stack wizard?! No problem! Welcome!

First we should create your land. For that you can either start your own new one, typing:
	
	~ git init <your land’s name> 

Or join to an existing craft union by typing:

	~ git clone <guild’s path>

We need a household in our land:

	~ mkdir <household’s name>

We need farms, stores and barracks:

	~ touch farm.txt store.txt barrack.txt

We wanna see how much of provision we have in our store:

	~ cat store.txt

If we want to add a couple of new warriors to the barrack, we can use: 

	~ (echo “cavalry” ; echo “catapult”) >> barrack.txt

You can check the current status of your land. Just go with:

	~ git status

At some point of the game you want to save some or all (-A) stuff that you possess. First you have to add them:

	~ git add <what you want>

Right away or after adding some more things, you need to type:

	~ git commit -m “hooray, I have created 2 barracks and 10 infantry units”

to save them.

You can see all your savings by:

	~ git log

If you lose the game at some point and want to go to a particular saving:

	~ git reset

If you want to test a new feature of your hero or want to go to some dangerous quest:

	~ git branch <let’s try it>

To switch to it type:

	~ git checkout <let's try it>

When you want to share all what you’ve gained with others, you do:

	~ git push

Cool game, isn’t it?! Good luck in your progress!
