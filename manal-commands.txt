Bash Commands:

-mkdir: stands for make directory and used to create new directory.
we can also create multiple sub-folders by using mkdir -p parent folder/subfolder1/subfolder2
 
-ls: mainly used to  list the files or the directories, we can sort our list by adding certain syntax to it like:
ls -l (detailed list)  
ls -t (by file time)
ls -s (by file size)
ls -r (reverse the sorting)
as we can use them all with one syntax
ls -lsr (show all files sorted by file size with the largest files at the bottom)

-mv: used to move or rename the directories.

-pwd: this print the current and exact directory we work in.
