HEllo this is a shor exeplination about some of the command that I use in the CLI:

cd: change diretory, I use this command to move between the directories on my computer.

mkidr: creat a directory, I use this command to creat a new directories.

touch: creat a file, I use this command to creat a new empty file.

ls: list the files in the cuurent directory

vi (file name): I use this to edite a text file on git bash

cat (filename); I use this to show the content of a file

git init : creat a repository 

git add : to add the file to the commit

git commit -m "here I put the message" : I use this to commit the added files (as Arco said: I close the box and I put a stamp on it. it is a good metaphor Arco)

/***** Those are the most commands that I use everyday since I started studying in tha amazing HYF *****/
